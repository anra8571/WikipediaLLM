Current strategies aim for deep and long-lasting remission, with the goal of preventing complications, such as surgery, and blocking disease progression. Central to these strategies is the introduction of early immunosuppression or combination therapy with biologicals in high-risk patients, combined with a tight and frequent control of inflammation, and adjustment of therapy on the basis of that assessment (treat to target strategy).

Because such models overwhelmingly train on existing data, measuring the data diversity that AI researchers value, but struggle to define, is crucial to ensuring the models are generally performant and able to cope with diversity in the way we imagine. The terms of power on which such diversity is explored and incorporated into the models will shape how they offer opportunity for diversity or force conformity.

Our first experience of non-verbal communication is in the natal womb; the synchronization of heartbeats between a mother and her unborn child, especially when the mother breathes rhythmically, suggests an intrinsic communication pathway. As we develop, humans convey information nonverbally through body language, facial expression, tone, touch, laughter, crying, facial blood flow and smell. Biochemical messengers can convey emotional states and trigger responses in others, often unconsciously. For instance, research has shown that human sweat contains compounds that, when detected by others, can convey stress or fear, influencing the receiver's perception and behavior.

The theory is closely related to the Bayesian brain framework and, over the last two decades, has gained substantial influence in the fields of theoretical and cognitive neuroscience. A large body of research has arisen based on both empirically testing improved and extended theoretical and mathematical models of predictive coding, as well as in evaluating their potential biological plausibility for implementation in the brain and the concrete neurophysiological and psychological predictions made by the theory. Despite this enduring popularity, however, no comprehensive review of predictive coding theory, and especially of recent developments in this field, exists. Here, we provide a comprehensive review both of the core mathematical structure and logic of predictive coding, thus complementing recent tutorials in the literature. We also review a wide range of classic and recent work within the framework, ranging from the neurobiologically realistic microcircuits that could implement predictive coding, to the close relationship between predictive coding and the widely-used backpropagation of error algorithm, as well as surveying the close relationships between predictive coding and modern machine learning techniques.", "question": "What is the core function of the brain according to predictive coding theory?", "source": "arxiv.org/abs/2107.12979", "answers": {"text": ["to minimize prediction errors with respect to a generative model of the world."], "answer_start": [131]}}

Natural polyphenols exert many health benefits, including ameliorative effects on skin aging. By affecting molecular pathways of senescence, polyphenols are able to prevent or delay the senescence formation and, consequently, avoid or ameliorate aging and age-associated pathologies of the skin. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge in skin aging and cellular senescence, and to summarize the recent in vitro studies related to the anti-senescent mechanisms of natural polyphenols carried out on keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts.

{"context": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and its atherothrombotic complications impose a substantial disease burden in Europe, representing a cost of \u20ac210 billion per year for the European Union. Hypertriglyceridemia, a major risk factor for premature ASCVD, is present in more than 20% of the European population, and is a key feature of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Recent findings from the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA) cohort in Spain showed that even in apparently healthy, middle-aged individuals without a history of cardiovascular (CV) risk, elevated triglyceride levels are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial inflammation. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic and genetic studies supports an independent causative role of triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and their remnants in this pathology. Icosapent ethyl (IPE) is a highly purified, stable ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that was initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, and subsequently received an expanded indication to reduce the risk of CV events in adult statin-treated patients. Approval was based on the pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT), which showed that high-dose IPE (4 g/day) significantly reduced the risk of primary and secondary composite endpoints comprising major CV events and CV death relative to placebo. In 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved IPE to reduce the risk of CV events in adult statin-treated patients at high CV risk with elevated triglyceride levels (\u22651.7 mmol/L [\u2265150 mg/dL]) and established CV disease, or diabetes and at least one other CV risk factor. Clinical studies in Europe, which included patients with acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and those undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, established that 12.5% to 23.3% of these high-risk populations may benefit from treatment with IPE. Such clinical benefit may in part result from the moderate triglyceride-lowering properties of IPE/EPA; equally however, concentrations of atherogenic remnant particle-cholesterol are markedly reduced. Furthermore, IPE/EPA exerts pleiotropic actions beyond its lipid-lowering properties, which include modulation of endothelial function, attenuation of intra-plaque inflammation and oxidative stress, and reduction in macrophage accumulation. Plasma phospholipids, into which EPA is primarily incorporated and transported, appear to serve as precursors for a series of anti-inflammatory metabolites involving the resolvins RvE1 to RvE3, a pathway which may confer cardioprotective benefits. In addition, plaque imaging data from the Effect of Icosapent Ethyl on Progression of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients With Elevated Triglycerides on Statin Therapy (EVAPORATE) and the Combination Therapy of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Pitavastatin for Coronary Plaque Regression Evaluated by Integrated Backscatter Intravascular Ultrasonography (CHERRY) trials show that plaque stabilization may be favorably affected. These factors may act synergistically to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce CV risk. In addition to robust efficacy data, multiple cost-utility studies across several countries indicate that IPE/EPA is a cost-effective treatment option that is favorably situated relative to some common willingness-to-pay thresholds. This review will evaluate the relevance of hypertriglyceridemia to residual ASCVD burden in statin-treated dyslipidemic patients, the potential of IPE/EPA to reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patient populations, and the mechanisms which may underlie these effects. Finally, the clinical implications of the EMA label for IPE will be critically appraised in light of the updated 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines on the management of dyslipidemia and the recent European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, together with considerations of its cost-effectiveness across several countries.", "question": "What is Icosapent ethyl (IPE) initially approved for by the FDA?", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304222/", "answers": {"text": ["to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia"], "answer_start": [1039]}}

Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the next day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their eyes met again, both were more conscious than before.

Sowerby published an extensive account of what became known as the \"Yorkshire Meteorite\" in his five-part mineralogical handbook, inviting pushback from geologists who thought that including a \"Pha\u00ebton from the heavens might seem absurd in a work on British Mineralogy\".

{"context": "Now the ancient Greeks began their contributions to mathematics around the time that zero as an empty place indicator was coming into use in Babylonian mathematics. The Greeks however did not adopt a positional number system. It is worth thinking just how significant this fact is. How could the brilliant mathematical advances of the Greeks not see them adopt a number system with all the advantages that the Babylonian place-value system possessed? The real answer to this question is more subtle than the simple answer that we are about to give, but basically the Greek mathematical achievements were based on geometry. Although Euclid's Elements contains a book on number theory, it is based on geometry. In other words Greek mathematicians did not need to name their numbers since they worked with numbers as lengths of lines. Numbers which required to be named for records were used by merchants, not mathematicians, and hence no clever notation was needed.", "question": "In ancient Greece, who used a positional number system?", "source": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Zero/", "answers": {"text": ["merchants"], "answer_start": [892]}}
